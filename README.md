Nancy McBride bio website
This project is to create and build the initial version of my bio repo and website. 

Beginning with index.html I am creating a 3 page website that includes an About Me page,
a Contact Me page and a page with references and links to my portfolio (Portfolio page).

First was to build the index.html with navbar which will toggle to the contact and portfolio pages. 
This website will be responsive for all sizes of display. I began this project with Bootstrap v5, which I later discovered is a beta version.
I then changed my bootstrap reference to the more stable ver 4.5. both for stability and ease in looking up reference documentation.

As my knowledge of coding grows I will be updating and adding to this basic site. 
I ran code validation and made corrections to all 3 html files. The PNG's are below.
